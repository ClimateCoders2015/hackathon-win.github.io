							<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><p>Our initiative aims to tackle global hunger by smartly connecting individuals to local food assistance with an inventive use of technology. Without relying on expensive mapping services, we've devised a method to intuitively guide those in need to the closest nutritional support centers. By harnessing simple yet effective digital tools, we offer a beacon of hope, making the journey towards sustenance both accessible and cost-effective. This project marks a stride forward in ensuring that no one is left hungry, regardless of their location. <a href="https://climatecoders2015.github.io/hackathon-win.github.io/Solution/index.html">(Discover Our Solution)</a></p></h3>

							<h2>Our Solution</h2>
							<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><p>By using the geolocation function on Java script, we have accurately obtained the latitude and the longitude of the user, after that we use the Haversine formula to calculate the displacements between the location and the food banks. The code then automatically selects the closest foodbank. While this is not as accurate as calculating distance, it does give a representation of the closeness of a foodbank to that  location. While we did try to use an API key for an accurate distance calculator, the Google Maps API was $200, which was  way too high. We worked around this problem by adding possible deviation values and conditions. We used javascript to execute a cost calculator based on the data to help with estimation. The cost calculator takes the distance that is the displacement multiplied by 2 which was calculated for the closest food bank, and then divides it by the km per liter and then multiplies it with the months fuel price (2.92 for special 95 during the month of march). It also adds any additional costs that may be associated with the delivery. We have also included a system that provides directions using arrays.</p></h3>

							<h2>About the Challenge</h2>
							<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><p>With over 690 million individuals enduring chronic hunger globally, the relentless grip of food scarcity tightens as climate change unleashes devastating extreme weather events like droughts and floods. This environmental upheaval further compounds the plight of those already struggling to secure their next meal. The very foundation of our food systems trembles under the looming shadow of climate change, threatening agricultural biodiversity and suffocating crop yields. As climate change and food insecurity entwine in a perilous dance of desperation, they amplify each other's destructive force in a relentless cycle of suffering. To combat these twin terrors, we must embrace holistic solutions that navigate the intricate web of environmental, social, and economic factors at play. With the global population hurtling towards 9.7 billion by 2050, the urgency of our mission cannot be overstated.</p></h3>

							<h2>Our Team's Edge: Innovating for Environmental Solutions</h2>
							<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><p>We are a dynamic team of students united by a common goal: leveraging our collective talents to drive positive change for the environment. Despite our differences, we share a deep passion for sustainability and a firm belief in the power of collaboration to effect meaningful change. What sets our team apart is our innovative, time-saving and collaborative approach to creating sustainable solutions.<a href="https://climatecoders2015.github.io/hackathon-win.github.io/Team%20Page/index.html"> (Click here for more details)</a></p>
							<p>Tech-Savvy Solutions: Leveraging technology is at the core of our approach. We recognize the transformative power of technology in addressing environmental issues, whether through developing cutting-edge renewable energy systems, implementing data-driven conservation strategies, or harnessing the potential of artificial intelligence for environmental monitoring and analysis.</p>
							<p>While our team is relatively young, we have already made significant strides in our journey towards environmental stewardship. Notably, each member has been recognized as an IGCSE topper in 2023, a testament to our academic excellence and dedication. In addition to our individual achievements, we have collectively engaged in guiding and mentoring teams of students in the STEAM-driven First Lego League competition during the academic years of 2022-23 and 2021-22. This involvement emphasized principles directly applicable to space exploration and engineering challenges, contributing to the success of the teams we mentoredâ€”with one team winning an award and two others securing awards in their respective years. Beyond our educational contributions, we have demonstrated our commitment to community service, accumulating over 100+ volunteering hours in both 2022 and 2023, further reflecting our dedication to making a positive impact. Our commitment to innovation and education extends further as we participated in the NASA Space App Challenge in both 2022 and 2023, showcasing our ability to apply our knowledge to real-world problems. We also contributed to TechnoVision 2023 and collaborated on editing various videos for compilations for The Winchester School, enhancing our skills in technology and communication. Moreover, our active participation in international hackathons focused on environmental innovation underscores our dedication to combating climate change and environmental degradation. With a foundation built on passion, expertise, and an innovative spirit, we are confident in our collective ability to make a meaningful difference in these critical areas.</p></h3>
